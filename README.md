# ShareCafe Streamer v3

## Inputs

* **Server IP & Port**: 192.168.151.33:1228
* **Show/Hide logs**: Play/Pause button on remote
* **Scroll Logs**: **Arrow Up** to scroll Up and **Arrow Down** to scroll down
    
## How to install
1. **Accept permission request on app first run**. This is very important to make the 
        app be able to store the downloaded files anywhere on the device.
2. **Enter the server ip and port** that is shown above. 
3. **Check the Show Indicator?** checkbox. This is optional but is highly recommended
    to accept to have the logs and indicator(top-right box) be visible immediately 
    after pressing Start Playing button.
4. After making sure that the server ip and port is correct, **press Start Playing**.
5. To understand what the indicators do, refer to the Indicators section below.
6. **Wait for the downloads to finish**. If some errors occurred, refer to the 
    Troubleshooting section below.
7. **After 3 successful loops**, the app should be fine. **Hide the indicators** by pressing 
    the play/pause button of the remote if the indicators are visible.

## Indicators

1. **Square at top-right corner.** If it's color blue, the current video is streamed. 
    If it's color orange, the current video is from file.
2. **Logs.** I made it as self-explainatory as possible so others can 
    understand easily. Refer to the code if needed because there are a lot of it.
    
## Troubleshooting
    
1. If download doesn't start immediately. Check if LAN is connected. 
    Android doesn't support download over LAN, especially non-Android TV devices. 
    If LAN is not connected, wait patiently until downloads are completed. The 
    last thing you want to do is do a reinstall. If a reinstall is made, repeat 
    the steps for installing.
2. If the app crashed, go to https://fabric.io/integritynet-solutions-and-services/android/apps/biz.integritynet.com.sharecafestreamerexoplayer/issues.
